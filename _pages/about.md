Hi! I’m M. Haseeb, a control engineer and an enthusiastic programmer, currently enrolled in the [Department of Electrical Engineering](http://www.kfupm.edu.sa/departments/ee/default.aspx) at KFUPM, Saudi Arabia as a full time graduate student.

Most of my research work is focused on **Machine Drives** and **Multilevel Inverters**. I’ve published two conference papers for **Two-Phase Symmetrical Induction Motor Drive** and currently working on 4 potential papers for **Finite Set Control Model Predictive Torque Control of Induction Motor**. Recently I've started exploring the usefulness of machine learning in industrial drives. 

I study topics including stochastic theory, advanced power electronic, convex optimization theory, evolutionary programming, adaptive control, digital signal processing, machine learning: introduction to fundamentals and intelligent control. As today's world is increasingly made possible through verification of software simulations, my work also is more focused towards the experimental validation of the proposed design simulations.

I received my M.Sc from [UET Lahore - Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.uet.edu.pk/faculties/facultiesinfo/department?RID=introduction&id=9), and my B.Sc. from [PU - Department of Electrical Engineering](http://pu.edu.pk/home/subdepartment/67003). I consider myself an inter-disciplinary nomad, working in disciplines like computer science, information science, electrical engineering, and management science.
