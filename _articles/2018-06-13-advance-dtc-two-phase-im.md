excerpt: "In this paper, a modified direct torque control (DTC) method for four-switch two-leg inverter, also known as B4 inverter, fed two-phase symmetrical induction motor is proposed. The presented technique shows a prospect of developing a similar DTC strategy of six-switch fed three-leg three-phase induction motor by emulation. With the help of suitable combinations of active intrinsic vectors of B4 inverter, enhanced torque dynamics as well as considerable reduction in torque ripple is achieved. Simulation results confirm the high performance of the proposed technique, which ultimately can very effectively be employed in automotive industry."

Abstract: In this paper, a modified direct torque control (DTC) method for four-switch two-leg inverter, also known as B4 inverter, fed two-phase symmetrical induction motor is proposed. The presented technique shows a prospect of developing a similar DTC strategy of six-switch fed three-leg three-phase induction motor by emulation. With the help of suitable combinations of active intrinsic vectors of B4 inverter, enhanced torque dynamics as well as considerable reduction in torque ripple is achieved. Simulation results confirm the high performance of the proposed technique, which ultimately can very effectively be employed in automotive industry.
