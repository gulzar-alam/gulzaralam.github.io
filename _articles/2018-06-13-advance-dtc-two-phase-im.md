title: "How Feasible Moving Target Defense is Within ICS Environment"
category: articles
permalink: 
excerpt: "Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are designed to work for long periods of time with a very deterministic
behavior as availability and reliability are the most important requirements mandated in operating critical
infrastructures. Embracing cyber security defenses in such environments is of utmost importance as
compromising these systems may lead to significant impacts to the facilities operated by such systems. Here,
the order is control, availability, integrity and confidentiality as opposed to CIA model adopted in equivalent
IT networks. This paper attepts to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of moving target defense as
security protection within ICS environment considering packet latency as the main metric. Among the
available MTD mechanisms, this paper selects to simulate the IP randomization capitalizing on the use of
Software Defined Networks (SDN). It encourages applying MTD within ICS environment provided that
packet size is maintained around 1024 bytes which introduces a delay under 50 mSec, an acceptable latency
to large ICS installations around the world."
