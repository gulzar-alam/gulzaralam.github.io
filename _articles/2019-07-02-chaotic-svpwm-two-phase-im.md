excerpt: "Based on chaos theory, a hybrid space vector pulse width modulation, Chaotic SVPWM, is proposed. The conventional SVPWM contains harmonic components with higher amplitudes around the switching frequency (fixed) whereas the proposed chaotic SVPWM is operated at chaotic period of the inverter thereby varying the switching frequency for the inverter. Because of this varying switching frequency, the peak value of harmonics got distributed over the output harmonics spectrum of the inverter, effectively suppressing the influence of harmonics and ultimately reducing the current/torque ripple of the induction motor. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is cost efficient, straightforward and can be used to suppress EMI characteristics of the inverter. The design methodology is based on a two-phase power system, but it can easily be extended for n-phase systems as well. The simulation is performed in MATLAB to validate this C-SVPWM control technique."

Abstract: Based on chaos theory, a hybrid space vector pulse width modulation, Chaotic SVPWM, is proposed. The conventional SVPWM contains harmonic components with higher amplitudes around the switching frequency (fixed) whereas the proposed chaotic SVPWM is operated at chaotic period of the inverter thereby varying the switching frequency for the inverter. Because of this varying switching frequency, the peak value of harmonics got distributed over the output harmonics spectrum of the inverter, effectively suppressing the influence of harmonics and ultimately reducing the current/torque ripple of the induction motor. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is cost efficient, straightforward and can be used to suppress EMI characteristics of the inverter. The design methodology is based on a two-phase power system, but it can easily be extended for n-phase systems as well. The simulation is performed in MATLAB to validate this C-SVPWM control technique.
