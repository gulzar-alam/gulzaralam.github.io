excerpt: "This paper discusses different healthcare information access record systems development techniques and sharing techniques with patient and physician. It provides a theoretical study to find out the latest techniques used by healthcare information sharing organizations which have a legal access and keep the patient data secured. We have proposed a system, which give access to the electronic record of a patient by using two-factor authentication protocol which is an efficient and more secure access method. This system is for both literate and illiterate people, which requires the National Identity Card Number (CNIC) and mobile device. The physician needs computer or mobile phone to access the model services. The electronic medical records are stored in a database which can be accessed by the authorized person physician or patient through two-factor authentication protocol. Each individual accessed through the two-factor authentication process, which makes this system secure and non-vulnerable. It provides a onetime password, which is only valid for only one login session."

Abstract: This paper discusses different healthcare information access record systems development techniques and sharing techniques with patient and physician. It provides a theoretical study to find out the latest techniques used by healthcare information sharing organizations which have a legal access and keep the patient data secured. We have proposed a system, which give access to the electronic record of a patient by using two-factor authentication protocol which is an efficient and more secure access method. This system is for both literate and illiterate people, which requires the National Identity Card Number (CNIC) and mobile device. The physician needs computer or mobile phone to access the model services. The electronic medical records are stored in a database which can be accessed by the authorized person physician or patient through two-factor authentication protocol. Each individual accessed through the two-factor authentication process, which makes this system secure and non-vulnerable. It provides a onetime password, which is only valid for only one login session.
